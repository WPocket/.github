# What makes WPocket different?
### there are many things that make WPocket different from other Distributed Computing applications
The main thing that WPocket different is that each of the smaller components were designed with working with each other in mind, but are all capable of working independently to some degree.
For example:
- EGAD is an api designed to take multiple different databases and unify all of them under one api interface
- KeyMaster is an API key management utility (requires EGAD)

both of these are capable of being separated from the dependency chain and run without all the other applications
or you can replace any part of the chain with one of your own, as long as it follows the same standards for communication.

Another thing that makes WPocket different from other solutions is that each of the components were designed with the other in mind, meaning it was built from the groud up with distributed computing and scalability in mind.
